WHEELCHAIR LOCATIONS: The Paramount Wheelchair Accessible location is a flat concrete area for the wheelchair and a fixed seat for a companion. THERE IS NO CHAIR IN THIS AREA TO ACCOMMODATE THE WHEELCHAIR PATRON. The patron will remain in their wheelchair for the duration of the show.

If the patron arrive without a wheelchair and have tickets for wheelchair location, they WILL NOT BE ACCOMODATED. The Paramount Theatre has a limited number of spaces available for patrons in wheelchairs and they are solely for the purpose of accomodating patrons in wheelchairs. Patrons may exchange regular seating tickets for wheelchair location under special circumstances. The Paramount will make every effort to accomodate such requests but cannot guarantee the availability of wheelchair seating for sold out performances. Under no circumstance may patrons exchange wheelchair location tickets for regular seating. TRANSFER SEATS: If the wheelchair patron is able to transfer from their wheelchair to a fixed seat, The Paramount is equipped to handle the request. We refer to these seats as transfer seats. The arm swings open in order for the patron to slide out of their wheelchair into the fixed seat. The patron's wheelchair must be taken to the back of the theatre to comply with local fire regulations. At the end of the performance the usher will return with the wheelchair. Transfer seats may also be used to accommodate patrons with crutches or walkers.
